# Family Promise Service Tracker

Family Promise helps local communities coordinate their compassion to address the root causes of family homelessness. They tap existing local resources to empower families towards economic stability. Families come to them in crisis; they help them rebuild their lives with new skills and ongoing support. They address the issue holistically, providing prevention services before families reach crisis, shelter and case management when they become homeless, and stabilization programs once they have secured housing to ensure they remain independent.

Family Promise needs a way to track and visualize the services they provide external to the shelter to gain actionable insights.

Our goal is to build a generalizable monitoring and evaluation (M&E) platform that meets Family Promise's needs, with an eye toward additional potential use cases that would be useful for many other organizations.
